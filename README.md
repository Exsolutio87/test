Tic Tac Toe @ Emilio
This is a simple Game, named Tic Tac Toe.

It runs out of the console and contains a 2d array. 
It is declared to "char 1-9" for the input of the two players (SpielerX and SpielerO).
"Spiel" is the main method where all comes together. 
In "Spielfeld" you see the arrays and a statement to draw the board
